## Overview
 This is an order-summary-template that can be used in big projects that involve placing order. It has a beautiful design which can make websites more attractive and user friendly. It shows how interactive element would look after hovering on them. It shows the details and summary of the pack selected by user and asks user if they want to confirm their order or cancel their order.It also gives the user an option to change order.

### What I learned

1. I learned how to make responsive design pages. I learned the importance of using the right units and the usage of media query.
2. I got to know about a very useful tag named nth child tag during this project

.below-image p:nth-child(2){
}

3. Learned more about color coordination.
4. I learned how to take screenshots and upload them in readme file

### Continued development

I feel like I should practice flexbox and responsive designs more. I want to perfect the correct usage of units whose importance I didn't realise before making this project. I want to learn the css grid which I encountered multiple time while taking help from internet.I want to get better at documentation of my project.



### Useful resources
